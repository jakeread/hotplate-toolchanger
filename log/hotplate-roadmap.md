## Hotplate Plans 

This, I think also we could write a little paper? The sequence here is to finish the BRH, bring that & this to a meeting with Marty to check about where / how to publish it. 

### Metrics 

- fabricatability
- stiffness 
- repeatability 
- coarse alignment 
- tool variety / tool flexibility 

### Related Work 

Jubilee... E3D, Prusa, theoretical? Should be able to calculate based on kinematic mount w/ central spring of parameterized size. 

### Design 

- is potentially novel kinematic mount
- is fabricable 
- is easily tram- / adjustable 

### Evaluation 

- quantifying repeatability & stiffness is the science to do 
- will want 2 do differential loadcell measurements (i.e. test x-carriage only to loadcell, thru structure: that's baseline), then measurement taken from HP's center: the difference is the quality of the mount 
- stiffness could compare to spring-loaded "simple" planar-loaded mounts 
  - or compare directly to jubilee toolchanger 
  - or compare to same load probes, bolted directly onto machine, same idea as isolating toolchanger-only stiffness loss
